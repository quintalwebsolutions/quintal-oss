## useAsyncReducer

The `useAsyncReducer` hook is a variation of React's core useReducer hook. Not a fork, but heavily inspired by [@bitovi/use-simple-reducer](https://github.com/bitovi/use-simple-reducer).

`useAsyncReducer` takes an initial state object (or (async) factory) and an object of actions that would modify the state, and returns a boolean `isInitialised` indicating if the initial state is ready to be used, an object containing the current state, the actions that may be performed on the state, a boolean `isLoading` indicating if an action is processing, and an error object for if one of the actions threw an error. All of this with full type-safety.

### Actions

Actions are sync or async functions that accept a state and additional parameters, and return the next state.

```tsx
import { useAsyncReducer } from '@quintal/use-async-reducer';
import { ReactElement } from 'react';

export default function IncrementButtons(): ReactElement {
  const { state, actions } = useAsyncReducer(
    { count: 0 },
    {
      reset: ({ initialState }) => initialState,
      increment: ({ currentState }) => ({ count: currentState.count + 1 }),
      add: async ({ currentState }, n: number) => ({ count: currentState.count + n }),
    },
  );

  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={actions.increment}>increment</button>
      <button onClick={() => actions.add(5)}>add 5</button>
    </>
  );
}
```

Even though `add` was defined as an async function, it is called as a sync function with the predefined parameters (all type-safe). You can add as many parameters as you'd like and they can be of any type.

### Queue

If async functions are called after each other, they are added to a queue and are executed one after another. During this execution, the `isLoading` boolean will be `true`.

### Error handling

Any errors thrown within actions are caught and returned using the `error` object, which is `null` as long as there hasn't been an error.

```ts
const { error } = useAsyncReducer(
  { count: 0 },
  {
    error: () => {
      throw Error('Something went horribly wrong');
    },
  },
);
```

If an error has occurred, the `error` object looks like this:

```ts
interface Error<State> {
  message: string;
  action: Action<State>;
  pendingActions: Action<State>[];
  runFailedAction: () => void;
  runPendingActions: () => void;
  runAllActions: () => void;
}
```
