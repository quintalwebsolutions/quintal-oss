# Contributing to Quintal Open Source Software

If you're reading this, you're probably thinking of contributing to this open source project. That's great! Your input is very welcome ðŸŽ‰

Contributing to the project can be done in multiple ways:

- Reporting bugs or other issues
- Proposing new features
- Implementing bug fixes or features

## Reporting Bugs or Feature Requests

1. Before submitting an issue, please look through [the existing issues](https://github.com/quintalwebsolutions/quintal-oss/issues) to see if your idea is something new.
2. Comment on an existing issue that you would like to help solve, or [create a new issue](https://github.com/quintalwebsolutions/quintal-oss/issues/new/choose). It's usually best to get some feedback before proceeding to write code.
3. Please make sure that you are comfortable with [our code of conduct](https://github.com/quintalwebsolutions/quintal-oss/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Implementing Bug Fixes or Features

1. Fork the repo and clone it.
2. Create a new branch from main with the naming convention (feat|fix|chore)/descriptive-branch-name (e.g. `git switch -c feature/add-arguments`).
3. In the root directory (at the same level as this guide), run `pnpm i`.
4. You can use the commands `pnpm lint`, `pnpm test`, and `pnpm dev` during development. The commmand `pnpm dev` runs tests in watch mode, because we practice test-driven development.
5. Run `pnpm changeset` for each implemented change that should be added to the changelog.
6. When you're done implementing your code, please make sure that `pnpm lint`, `pnpm test` and `pnpm build` pass without unexpected warnings or errors.
7. Create a new pull request and select the branch in your forked repo as the "compare branch".
